## 📋 Prerequisites

### Option 1: Local Development
- **Python 3.8+** - [Download](https://www.python.org/)
- **Node.js 16+** - [Download](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)

### Option 2: Docker (Recommended)
- **Docker** - [Download](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- **Docker Compose** - [Download](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

Check installations:
```bash
python --version
node --version
npm --version
docker --version
docker-compose --version
```

---

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### 🐳 Quick Start with Docker (Recommended) ⭐

#### 1. Navigate to Project
```bash
cd d:\edmo
```

#### 2. Start with Docker Compose
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This single command:
- Builds backend and frontend images
- Starts both services
- Configures networking
- Performs health checks

Expected output:
```
enrollment_assistant_backend  | INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000
enrollment_assistant_frontend | ⇨ listening on http://0.0.0.0:3000
```

#### 3. Open Browser
Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

✅ **That's it! Application is ready to use.**

---

### Local Development Setup (Without Docker)

#### Step 1: Clone or Navigate to Project Directory

```bash
cd d:\edmo
```

### Step 2: Setup Backend (FastAPI)

#### 2.1 Create Python Virtual Environment

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
# source venv/bin/activate
```

#### 2.2 Install Backend Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Dependencies:**
- `fastapi` - Web framework for APIs
- `uvicorn` - ASGI server
- `pydantic` - Data validation
- `python-multipart` - Form parsing

#### 2.3 Verify Backend Setup

```bash
python main.py
```

You should see:
```
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop. Backend is ready!

---

### Step 3: Setup Frontend (React + Vite)

#### 3.1 Navigate to Frontend Directory

```bash
# From backend, go back to project root
cd ..
cd frontend
```

#### 3.2 Install Frontend Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This installs:
- `react` - UI library
- `react-dom` - React DOM rendering
- `axios` - HTTP client
- `vite` - Build tool
- `@vitejs/plugin-react` - React plugin for Vite

---

## ▶️ Running the Application

### Terminal 1: Start Backend Server

```bash
cd backend

# Activate virtual environment (if not already activated)
# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

# Start FastAPI server
python main.py
```

Expected output:
```
INFO:     Application startup complete
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

**Backend running at**: `http://localhost:8000`
**API Documentation**: `http://localhost:8000/docs` (Swagger UI)

### Terminal 2: Start Frontend Development Server

```bash
cd frontend

# Start Vite development server
npm run dev
```

Expected output:
```
  VITE v5.0.0  ready in 123 ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:3000/
  ➜  press h + enter to show help
```

**Frontend running at**: `http://localhost:3000`

## 🔧 Backend Architecture

### Agent Loop Flow

```
User Input
    ↓
Extract Entities (program names, applicant IDs)
    ↓
Decide Tools to Call (based on user intent)
    ↓
Execute Tools (call specialized functions)
    ↓
Generate Response (format results naturally)
    ↓
Update Session Memory (remember context)
    ↓
Return to Frontend
```

### Key Components:

**StudentEnrollmentAgent** (`agents.py`)
- `get_or_create_session()` - Manages user context
- `extract_entities()` - Finds program names and applicant IDs
- `decide_tools_to_call()` - Determines which tools to use
- `execute_tools()` - Runs selected tools
- `generate_response()` - Creates natural language responses
- `process_message()` - Main agent loop orchestrator

**Tools** (`tools.py`)
- `get_program_info()` - Program details
- `check_application_status()` - Application status
- `get_deadlines()` - Important dates

---

## 🎓 How the Agent Works

### Context Memory

The agent remembers:
- **applicant_id**: Once provided, reused in subsequent messages
- **current_program**: Tracks which program user is asking about
- **conversation_history**: Stores all interactions in a session

Example:
```
Turn 1: "What about Computer Science?"
→ Agent remembers: current_program = "Computer Science"

Turn 2: "What's the deadline?"
→ Agent uses: current_program from memory (no need to specify again)
```

### Tool Decision Logic

The agent intelligently decides which tools to call:

| User Intent | Tools Called | Examples |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| Ask about programs | `get_program_info` | "Tell me about CS", "What programs?" |
| Ask about deadlines | `get_deadlines` | "When's the deadline?", "Application due date?" |
| Check status | `check_application_status` | "What's my status?", "Where's my app?" |
| Financial questions | None (escalate) | "Fee waiver?", "Scholarship?" |

### Escalation

For out-of-scope questions, the agent gracefully escalates:
```
Agent: "I'd recommend speaking with an enrollment counselor 
for that. Would you like me to connect you?"
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Docker Issues

**Container won't start**
```bash
# Check logs for errors
docker-compose logs -f backend
docker-compose logs -f frontend

# Rebuild without cache
docker-compose down
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up
```

**Port already in use**
```bash
# Check what's using the port
netstat -ano | findstr :8000    # Windows
lsof -i :8000                   # macOS/Linux

# Run on different ports
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -p enrollment2 up
```

**Health checks failing**
```bash
# Check backend health
docker exec enrollment_assistant_backend curl http://localhost:8000/api/health

# Check frontend health
docker exec enrollment_assistant_frontend wget -q -O- http://localhost:3000
```

**Network connectivity**
```bash
# Verify services can communicate
docker-compose ps    # Check status
docker network ls    # Check networks
docker network inspect enrollment_network  # Check connections
```

### Local Setup Issues

**Backend won't start**
```bash
# Problem: ModuleNotFoundError
# Solution: Ensure virtual environment is activated
venv\Scripts\activate

# Problem: Port 8000 already in use
# Solution: Kill process on port 8000 or use different port
uvicorn main:app --port 8001

# Problem: data.json not found
# Solution: Verify backend/data.json exists with 102 applicant records
```

**Frontend won't start**
```bash
# Problem: npm command not found
# Solution: Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/

# Problem: Port 3000 already in use
# Solution: Kill process or specify different port in vite.config.js

# Problem: CORS errors
# Solution: Backend CORS is already configured, ensure backend is running
```

**API calls failing**
```bash
# Check backend is running
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health

# Check available programs
curl http://localhost:8000/api/available-programs

# Check statistics (should show 102 applicants)
curl http://localhost:8000/api/statistics
```

**Data not loading**
```bash
# Verify data.json exists and is valid JSON
cat backend/data.json | python -m json.tool

# Check if tools can access data
curl http://localhost:8000/api/statistics

# Should return: total_applicants: 102, total_programs: 5
```

### Common Messages

**"Cannot find applicant APP-XXXX"**
- Solution: Use applicants from APP-1001 to APP-1102
- Test with: APP-1001, APP-1042, APP-1089

**"Program not found"**
- Solution: Use exact program names:
  - Computer Science
  - Business Administration
  - Mechanical Engineering
  - Data Science
  - Civil Engineering

## 📝 Development Notes

### Extending the Agent

To add new tools:

1. **Add tool function** in `tools.py`:
```python
def new_tool_name(param: str) -> dict:
    return {"success": True, "data": {...}}
```

2. **Register tool** in `TOOLS` dict:
```python
TOOLS = {
    "new_tool_name": new_tool_name,
    ...
}
```

3. **Add decision logic** in `agents.py`:
```python
if "keyword" in message_lower:
    tools_to_call.append(("new_tool_name", {"param": value}))
```

4. **Add response formatting** in `generate_response()`:
```python
elif tool_name == "new_tool_name":
    response_parts.append(f"Formatted response: {data}")
```
